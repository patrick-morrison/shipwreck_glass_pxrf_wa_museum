# Shipwreck Glass pXRF Analysis

This is the data analysis for a project with the Western Australian Museum. Our purpose was to look at shipwreck glass in the collection using [pXRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_fluorescence), to determine if we could identify patterns related to manufacture or site formation.

- data_cleaning.R takes the raw output from excel files and tidies it
- glass_analysis.R produces figures from these tidy data files
- shipwrecks_map.R produces the map figure

All the data and R script are available here.

Authors are Patrick Morrison and Deb Shefi.
