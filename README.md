# Shipwreck Glass pXRF Analysis

This is the data analysis for a project with the Western Australian Museum. Our purpose was to look at shipwreck glass in the collection using [pXRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_fluorescence), to determine if we could identify patterns related to manufacture or site formation.

All the data and R script are available here.
